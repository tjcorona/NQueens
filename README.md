NQueens

Algorithms to solve the N Queens puzzle (N by N chess board, place N
queens so no queen can attack another).  I have written a backtracking
solver, and an implementation of Dancing Links
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dancing_Links).  Additionally, I have
written a simple tool to remove solutions that are equivalent under
reflections and rotations, and I have constructed a high-tech ASCII
chess board.
